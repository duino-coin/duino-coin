## Commnicating with the master server

### Socket API

To build your own Duino-Coin apps, here's a list of of commands the master server accepts.
To start communication however, firstly you need to connect to the server. For now you have two options:
*   TCP connection
    * `tcp://51.15.127.80:2811` - General purpose port
    * `tcp://51.15.127.80:2812` - General purpose port
    * `tcp://51.15.127.80:2813` - General purpose port
    * Note: you can also use `server.duinocoin.com` instead of `51.15.127.80`
*   Secure Websocket sonnection (SSL required)
    *  `wss://server.duinocoin.com:14808` - Proxied to **pulsepool** for webmining
    *  `wss://server.duinocoin.com:15808` - General purpose port used for wallets

**Make sure you don't create more more than 50 connections in time shorter than 30 seconds.**
If you do that, the server may ban your IP for creating too much traffic and being a potential DDoS attacker.

After connecting, the server will send its version number it's currently on (2.4).
At this point you can send `LOGI` or `REGI` request to login or register an account or `JOB,username` to receive job for mining.
To login, send `LOGI,username,password` - replace username and password with credentials. After sucessfull login server will send `OK`.
If login fails, server will send `NO,Reason of failed login`.

To register, send `REGI,username,password,email` - again, by replacing the placeholders with the respective data.
After sucessful registration, the server will send `OK`.
If the registration fails, the server will send `NO,Reason of failed registration`.

After loging-in you have access to the following commands:
*   `PING` - Server will return "Pong!" message ASAP 
*   `BALA` - Server will return balance of current user
*   `ESTP,username` - Server will return the 24h estimated profits of user
*   `UEXI,username` - Server will check if the user is registered and return `NO,User is not registered` or `OK,User is registered`
*   `SEND,message,recipients_username,amount` - Send funds to someone, the server will return a message about the state of the transaction
*   `GTXL,username,num` - Get last *num* of transactions involving *username* (both deposits and withdrawals)
*   `CHGP,oldPassword,newPassword` - Change password of current user
*   `WRAP,amount,tronAddress` - Wrap DUCO on Tron network (wDUCO)
*    wDUCO unwrapping:
     1.  Send a Tron transaction with method `initiateWithdraw(duco_username,amount)`
     2.  Send a server call `UNWRAP,amount,tron_address`

### REST JSON API

Documentation for DUCO REST api is available here: [duco-rest-api](https://github.com/revoxhere/duco-rest-api).
To access these functions, just add the query URL after the server address: `https://server.duinocoin.com/<query>`.

## Communicating with a duino-coin pool

### Socket APi


To build your own Duino-Coin miner, here's a list of of commands the pools accept.
To start communication however, firstly you need to get the Pool Ip and port

*   JSON
    * `server.duinocoin.com/getPool` - To get some json returned containing the pool ip and port(e.g.{"name":"pulse-pool-2","ip":"149.91.88.18","port":6002,"connections":9689})
*   Via the main server over wss(SSl required)
    *  `wss://server.duinocoin.com:14808` - Proxied to **pulsepool** for webmining

Now you can connect to it.

After connecting, the pool will send its version number it's currently on (2.6).

*   `JOB,username` (or `JOBXX,username` for XXHASH) - Pool will return job for mining using DUCO-S1 (-S1A)
    *   You can ask for a specific mining difficulty: `JOB,username,DIFF` (if you don't ask for a specific difficulty, the network diff will be given) where diff is one of the below:
        * `AVR`     - diff      6 - used for mining on Arduino, AVR boards
        * `ARM`     - diff    500 - not used anywhere officially yet
        * `DUE`     - diff   1000 - planned for mining on Arduino Due boards
        * `ESP8266` - diff   1500 - used for mining on ESP8266 boards 
        * `ESP32`   - diff   2400 - used for mining on ESP32 boards
        * `LOW`     - diff   7.5k - used for mining on Web Miner, RPis, PC
        * `MEDIUM`  - diff    75k - used for mining on PC
        * `NET`     - diff  ~500k - used for mining on PC (network difficulty)
        * `EXTREME` - diff    1M+ - not used anywhere officially yet
    *   When sending the mining result, you can pass the hashrate count and the name of the miner along with rig name to display in the API, e.g.`6801,250000,My Cool Miner v4.20,House Miner` indicates that result 6801 was found, the hashrate was 250000H/s (250kH/s) and the name of the software was "My Cool Miner v4.20" with a rig named "House Miner"
        *   If hashrate is not received, server estimates it from time it took to receive share and sets `"Is estimated": "True"` in the API
        *   If software name is not received, server uses `"Software": "Unknown"` in the API
        *   If rig name is not received, server uses `"Identifier": "None"` in the API


## C DUCO library

If you want to easily access the Duino-Coin API with your C apps, you can use [libduco](https://github.com/SarahIsWeird/libduco) which is made by [@Sarah](https://github.com/SarahIsWeird/). [@ygboucherk](https://github.com/ygboucherk) is also working on one wich you can access here [duino-coin-C-lib](https://github.com/ygboucherk/duino-coin-C-lib)

## Python3 DUCO module

If you want to easily access the Duino-Coin API with your Python3 apps, [@connorhess](https://github.com/connorhess) made an official module for that here: [duco_api](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/tree/useful-tools/duco_api).
