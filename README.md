<h2 align="center">Master server API</h2><br>

To build your own Duino-Coin apps, here's a list of of commands the master server accepts.
To start communication however, firstly you need to connect to the server. For now you have two options:
*   TCP connection (recommended) - server IP and port are static: `tcp://51.15.127.80:2811`
*   Websocket connection (through proxy - may not be available 100% of the time) - server IP and port are static: `ws://51.15.127.80:15808`

**Make sure you don't create more than 24 connections per IP address and don't make more than 10 connections in time shorter than 30 seconds.**
If you do that, server may ban your IP for creating too much traffic and being a potential DDoS attacker.
If you happen to get banned, wait about 30 seconds to get unbanned automatically.

After connecting, the server will send version number it's currently on (2.0).
At this point you can send `LOGI` or `REGI` request to login or register an account or `JOB,username` to receive job for mining.
To login, send `LOGI,username,password` - replace username and password with credentials. After sucessfull login server will send `OK`.
If login fails, server will send `NO,Reason of failed login`.

To register, send `REGI,username,password,email` - again, by replacing words with respective data.
After sucessfull registration server will send `OK`.
If registration fails, server will send `NO,Reason of failed registration`.

After loging-in you have access to the following commands:
*   `BALA` - Server will return balance of current user
*   `JOB` - Server will return job for mining
    * You can also use `JOB,username` to mine without loging-in
    * You can ask for a specific difficulty for mining: `JOB,username,DIFF` (if you don't ask for specific difficulty, you'll get the network diff) where diff is one of the below:
        * `AVR`     - diff     3 - used for official AVR boards mining
        * `ESP`     - diff    75 - used for official ESP boards mining
        * `500`     - custom 0.5k diff
        * `2500`    - custom 2.5k diff
        * `5000`    - custom   5k diff
        * `10000`   - custom  10k diff
        * `MEDIUM`  - diff    20k - used as lower-diff PC mining
        * `HIGH`    - custom  80k diff
        * `EXTREME` - diff   750k - for custom high performance miners
    
    *   When sending result, you can pass hashrate count and miner name to display in the API, e.g.(6801,250000,My Cool Miner v4.20) indicates that result 6801 was found, hashrate was 250000H/S (250kH/s) and software name was My Cool Miner v4.20
        *   If hashrate is not received, server estimates it from time it took to receive share and sets `"Is estimated": "True"` in the API
        *   If software name is not received, server uses `"Software": "Unknown"` in the API
*   `SEND,-,recipientUsername,amount` - Send funds to someone, server will return a message about state of the transaction
*   `CHGP,oldPassword,newPassword` - Change password of current user
*   `WRAP,amount,tronAddress` - Wrap some DUCO on tron
*  Unwrapping protocol is more complicated

    First, send a tron transaction with method `initiateWithdraw(ducoUsername,amount)`

    Then, send a server call to - `UNWRAP,amount,tronAddress`


<h2 align="center">C DUCO library</h2><br>

If you want to easily access Duino-Coin API with your C apps, [@ygboucherk](https://github.com/ygboucherk) is working on a library for that here: [duino-coin-C-lib](https://github.com/ygboucherk/duino-coin-C-lib)

<h2 align="center">Python3 DUCO API module</h2><br>

To build your own Duino-Coin apps we've created Duino-Coin API for python3. Here's the documentation for the module.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

```python
import duco_api
```

Initialize the connection to the server

```python
api_connection = duco_api.api_actions() #creates the api connection instance
```

The next step is to Login/Register <i>*Note: login and register do not require you to init but they close the connection after use*</i>
<h4>Login</h4>

```python
api_connection.login(username="username", password="password")
```

<h4>Register</h4>

```python
api_connection.register(username="username", password="password", email="user@example.com")
```

<h3>Functions</h3>
These functions require user being loged-in.

<h4>Balance</h4>
Gets the current balance of the logged-in user

```python
api_connection.balance() # takes no args
```

<h4>Transfer</h4>
Transfers Duco from logged-in user to the specified username

```python
api_connection.transfer(recipient_username='test_user1', amount=1)
```

<h4>reset password</h4>
Resets the password of the logged-in user

```python
api_connection.reset_pass(old_password='123', new_password='abc')
```

<h3>Other Functions</h3>
Use of this functions does not require being loged-in.

<h4>Get Duco Price</h4>
returns the current Duco price as a float

```python
>>> duco_api.get_duco_price() 
0.01249
```

<h4>Duco price update timer</h4>
starts a timer that updates the price at a specified interval in seconds (default is 15)

```python
>>> duco_api.start_duco_price_timer(interval = 5) # start the timer that updates the price every 5 seconds
>>> duco_api.duco_price # you can get the updated price from a global variable <duco_price>
0.01249
```

<h4>Example API script</h4>

```python
import duco_api

api_connection = duco_api.api_actions()

api_connection.login(username='YourUsername', password='YourPassword')

current_balance = api_connection.balance()
print(current_balance)

api_connection.close()
```


<h2 align="center">Duino-coin for the AUR!</h2><br>

You can get the whole duino-coin bundle now on the AUR.

Just install it with your favourite AUR Helper (for example: yay).

To get it faster, i will help y'all here:
1. Install git

```sudo pacman -S git```

2. You have to clone the yay repo.

```sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git```

3. Get into the Folder

```cd yay-git```

4. Next, build the package using the makepkg command below.

```makepkg -si```

5. Now you can use yay to install AUR packages

```yay -S duino-coin```

6. Have fun mining!
